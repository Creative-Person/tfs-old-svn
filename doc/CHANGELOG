[ Milestone
	Game protocol 9.70 support with new items.otb.
	Offline training!
	New VIP list code with VIP entries stored on the server side (SQLite part not done yet, but should work fine for MySQL users, the database will automatically be updated).
	Added walkstack attribute to items.xml.
	Added exhaustion to mounting.
	Updated a lot of items in items.xml.
	Players will no longer be muted for using NPC channel.
	Players will now be exhausted when trying to use an item even if the item use failed.
	Players with access level can now mount in protection zone.
	Removed the hardcoded highscores code.
	Optimized Creature::getPosition (significant for getSpectators which is one of the most called functions).
	Owner on ConditionDamage will no longer be serialized/deserialized as there is no reason to keep it after a relog.
	Updated Map::checkSightLine.
	Patched a monster bug fix from trunk.
	Reduced the Hicks! chance for drunk players.
	Waypoints support, with two new lua functions getWaypointPosition(name) and doWaypointAddTemporial(name, pos)
	onDeath for a summon will now only be called if the summons master still exists (in which case we can still tell if it's a summon in the onDeath script).
	Reworked the code for using items on creatures to address a few bugs with it.
	\n can now be used for new line in the questlog.
	Fixed the bug with /addskill <playername>, magic level where it would not accurately add exactly one magic level.
	Fixed the overflow checks for level, skills and magic level formulas (0 > 0 is not true!).
	Fixed a bug where a player with black skull could get red skull by killing players in pairs.
	Fixed a bug with doPlayerAddItem.
	Fixed a bug with yellow skull.
	Fixed container bugs.
