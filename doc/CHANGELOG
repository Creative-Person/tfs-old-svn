[ Milestone
	Fixed a bug when noDamageToSameLookfeet was enabled that caused no damage between monsters and players if they have the same lookfeet.
	Fixed a bug with "think" global events, they were only being executed once.
	Revised NPC system and extended global.lua with more Lua functions (thanks to Cykotitan).
